# Forest_Network
Codes for all projects based on forest networks.
My plan for this repo (slowly getting there):
1. A few folders for key common codes for all forest-network projects, including preparation of census data, spatial neighbrouhood calculation, network estimation with joint model and network index calculation.
2. Folder for each project, containing specific stats anlysis, ,simulations and figure codes
